================

HELLO WORLD / experimentation program running under CP/M-80, crosscompiled with SDCC (Small Devices C Compiler).
It's based on sources from http://n8vem-sbc.pbworks.com/ (maily found in the unified-bios package).

This comes without any warranty: It's mostly a experimentation code for my N8VEM SBC V2.
